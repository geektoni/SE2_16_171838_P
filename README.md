## Introduction

This is an application prototype for the Software Engineering Course Project. It was made based on a mockup idea produced during one interactive lesson based on The Gift Giving Project. You can find the proposed mockup [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8Hfs7DpCPvHWHJKeHFtOWFDM2M/view) (initially it was designed as a smarthphone application).

The application is hosted on Heroku and it is based on Node.js + Express.js and by a MongoDB database.
